# password-generator

## Description

Applying my recent learning, I have utilised JavaScript code to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. 

The app operates in the browser and presents the user with a series of prompts to determine the type and amount of characters the user requires for their random password.
